# Nuxtagram

> Nuxt.js project
This project is based on the youtube series [Learn Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEYKd5NC0A) from Wes Bos, in which an app is built called [Reduxtagram](https://github.com/wesbos/Learn-Redux).
This one is built with Nuxt instead, hence the title.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
